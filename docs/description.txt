The objective of the exercise is to implement label and row extraction methods that run on standardized text output from a PDF. These are two of the earliest methods we implemented in the platform. Label finds a value adjacent to an anchor line (some static line of text in the document), and row finds a value at approximately the same vertical position as the anchor line. I've attached a text file with sample input and output, a types file specifying the relevant types for the exercise, a redacted source PDF, and its text (in StandardizedText format, with the redacted pieces changed from their originals). A bonus challenge would be to expand the label method to capture multiline values, like under the pickup notes anchor in the PDF.
